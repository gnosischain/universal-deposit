## Features

### Boilerplate monorepo setup

Quickly start developing your offchain monorepo project with
minimal configuration overhead using Turborepo

### Sample library with Viem

Simple provider that uses Viem client to query account balances

### Sample contracts with Foundry

Basic Greeter contract with an external interface

Foundry configuration out-of-the-box

### Sample app that consumes the library

How much ETH do Vitalik and the Zero address hold together?

### Testing

Unit test setup with Vitest framework

### Lint and format

Use ESLint and Prettier to easily find issues as you code

## Overview

This repository is a monorepo consisting of 2 packages and 1 app:

-   [`@ts-turborepo-boilerplate/contracts`](./packages/contracts): A library for writing all required smart contracts
-   [`@ts-turborepo-boilerplate/sample-lib`](./packages/sample-lib): A sample library for querying account balances
-   [`@ts-turborepo-boilerplate/sample-app`](./apps/sample-app): A demo sample app that uses the sample-lib

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

-   [Viem](https://viem.sh/): lightweight library to interface with EVM based blockchains

### Configuring Prettier sort import plugin

You can further add sorting rules for your monorepo, for example in `.prettierrc` you can add:

```json
    ...
    "importOrder": [
        "<TYPES>",
        ...
        "",
        "<TYPES>^@myproject", //added
        "^@myproject/(.*)$", //added
        "",
        ...
    ],
    ...
```

We use [IanVs prettier-plugin-sort-imports](https://github.com/IanVS/prettier-plugin-sort-imports)

## Available Scripts

### `create-package`

The `create-package` script allows you to create a new package within the `packages` directory. It automates the setup of a new package with the necessary directory structure and initial files scaffolded.

#### Usage

To create a new package, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run create-package <package-name>
```

Replace `<package-name>` with your desired package name. This command will generate the package directory with predefined templates and configuration files.
